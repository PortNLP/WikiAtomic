Second Amendment to the United States Constitution,Created on December 15 1791. The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution is part of the United States Bill of Rights. The Second Amendment establishes the right of citizens to possess firearms for lawful purposes. When America was being colonized by European countries firearms were very important to colonists. When Europeans came to America they brought the idea of land ownership by an individual. Europeans received the right of land ownership from their king through land grants. Land ownership was completely foreign to Native Americans. Native Americans considered a particular territory belonged to the tribe. Colonists defended their claims against Native Americans. Colonists defended their claims against other Europeans. Other Europeans' kings may have granted them the same lands. Colonists needed firearms for hunting. Most colonists coming to America in the 17th century had no experience as soldiers. The British kept few soldiers in the colonies. Colonists found they needed to establish militias. Colonies had militia laws. In 1774 the British government attempted to disarm American colonists. In 1775 the British government attempted to disarm American colonists. The British government had a larger presence at that time. This caused the colonists to form private militias. Private militias were independent of any control by the governors appointed by the British government. The Minutemen who fought the British Army at the Battles of Lexington were an independent militia. The Minutemen who fought the British Army at Concord were an independent militia. After the American Revolutionary War the framers of the Constitution distrusted standing armies. Most Americans of the time distrusted standing armies. Americans of the time trusted militias. After the Revolutionary War Americans trusted state militias to defend the country. The Articles of Confederation called for each state to maintain a well-armed militia. The Articles of Confederation was the nation's first constitution. Congress could call up the militias to defend the country against any foreign power. Congress could only form a standing army if nine of the thirteen states approved. This was one of the weaknesses that led to the Constitutional Convention of 1787. Americans distrusted standing armies in the 18th century. The word army meant mercenaries in the 18th century. Americans were afraid standing armies could be used to take over the country. Virginia was one of the first colonies to adopt a state constitution. Other states followed with similar wording in their own constitutions. Pennsylvania declared standing armies in the time of peace are dangerous to liberty. Pennsylvania declared they ought not to be kept up. Pennsylvania declared the military should be kept under strict subordination to the civil power. Pennsylvania declared the military should be governed by the civil power. In 1781 the Continental Congress approved the Articles of Confederation. The Articles of Confederation recognized that the thirteen original states had the power to govern themselves. The states acted collectively to have a congress. The states did not provide any money to run the congress. There was no president. There was no court system. The confederation of states proved to be a very poor form of central government. The Constitutional Convention met in Philadelphia Pennsylvania from May 25 to September 17 1787. The purpose of the Constitutional Convention was to revise the Articles of Confederation.
Star,A star is a very large ball of bright glowing hot matter in space. That matter is called plasma. Stars are held together by gravity. Stars give out heat because they are very hot. Stars give out light because they are very hot. The Sun is a star. The Sun is at the centre of the solar system. The amount of material in a star is very large. The material in a star is called its mass. The star's mass starts a nuclear reaction. The nuclear reaction changes hydrogen to helium. The nuclear reaction gives off heat. Stars like the Sun are hot because the nuclear reaction happens inside them. The reaction is called nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion makes light. Nuclear fusion makes heat. Nuclear fusion makes bigger chemical elements. In the Sun the change produces helium. In the Sun small amounts of heavier elements are produced. Stars have a lot of hydrogen. Nuclear fusion changes hydrogen into helium. Fusion produces a lot of energy. The energy makes the star very hot. The energy produced by stars moves away from them. Much of the energy leaves as light. The rest of the energy leaves as other kinds of electromagnetic radiation. When a star like the Sun gets old it will expand in size. When the Sun gets old it will become a red giant star. That will happen in a billion years. The star nearest to Earth is the Sun. Energy from the Sun supports almost all life on Earth. The Sun provides light for plants. Plants turn the light into energy. The process of turning light into energy is called photosynthesis. Energy from the Sun causes weather on Earth. Energy from the Sun causes humidity on Earth. We can see other stars in the night sky. We can see other stars when the Sun goes down. Like the Sun other stars are made mostly of hydrogen. Other stars have a little bit of helium. Other stars have other elements. Astronomers often compare those other stars to the Sun. The mass of other stars is given in solar masses. A small star may be 0.2 solar masses. A big star may be 4.0 solar masses. The motion of the planets is called orbit. Many other stars have planets orbiting them. Those planets are called exoplanets. If you were on an exoplanet our Sun would look like a star in the sky. You could not see the Earth from an exoplanet.

Death,"Death is the end of a life in an organism. All biological activity of the living thing stops. All living activity of the living thing stops. The mind stops. The senses stop. In humans, death is signaled when the heart stops beating. The heart cannot be restarted. The heart stopping can be caused by many things. All living things have a limited lifespan. All living things eventually die. Living things that have died are described as dead. The death of humans is often investigated for the cause. This happens in cases of crime. Such cases include murder. This happens in cases of accident. This happens in cases of disease. Disease may continue to kill other humans. About 150,000 people die every day. It happens around the world. About two thirds of these deaths are due to age. Some believe humans have a soul. Some believe the soul can continue without a body. Some believe in the afterlife. Some believe in reincarnation. Reincarnation is moving into another body. Some believe in annihilationism. Annihilationism is ceasing to exist. Religions have different beliefs about this issue. Many cultures have customs to respect the dead. Many cultures have rituals to respect the dead. Deadly things that happen are called fatal. Diseases that cause death are called terminal. Humans are no different from other lifeforms in death. Our bodies have the ability for self-repair. That ability is limited. Finding the cause of death is called pathology. In medicine, death is when the heart stops beating for several minutes. People can sometimes recover after the heart has stopped for 30 minutes. This happens in cases such as near-drowning in cold water. Machines can help the heart work. Machines can help the lungs work. The moment of death is more difficult to determine with machines. Death is commonly a sad thing to people. Death is commonly an unpleasant thing to people. Death can make people think about their own death. People might miss the person who has died.

Internet Protocol,The Internet Protocol (IP) is a communications protocol. IP is in the Internet protocol suite. Its purpose is relaying data across network boundaries. IP establishes the Internet. In the past IP did not provide connectivity. IP only specified how packets are created. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) allowed connectivity. TCP provided functionality for connectivity. They earned the name TCP/IP. IP is similar to the postal system. IP allows addressing a package. IP allows dropping the package into the system. There is a web of links interconnecting. IP tells packets their destination. IP tells packets how to get there. TCP ensures a reliable connection. TCP checks packets for errors. TCP requests retransmission if it detects errors. The Internet Protocol gets information from a source computer. The Internet Protocol gets information to a destination computer. It sends information in the form of packets. There are two versions of the Internet Protocol in use. IPv4 is the most used version. IP gives computers an IP address. An IP address identifies computers. IP is the primary protocol in the Internet Layer. The Internet Protocol Suite consists of seven layers. The main purpose of IP is the delivery of datagrams. Datagrams are sent from the source host to the destination host. This is based on their addresses. IP includes methods for putting tags within datagrams. Tags contain address information. This process is called encapsulation. The datagram is divided into pieces. Each piece contains the address of the receiver. Each piece arrives at the receiver. Pieces often take different routes. IP puts all pieces back together before delivery. IP is a connectionless protocol. The circuit to the receiver does not need to be set up. A direct connection is not needed before transmission. IP was initially a connectionless datagram service. The Transmission Control Protocol was created later. TCP allowed connections. The Internet Protocol Suite is TCP/IP. IPv4 was the first major version of IP. IPv4 is the dominant protocol of the Internet. IPv6 is also in use. The deployment of IPv6 is increasing worldwide. Addressing aspects of IP are complex.

Photography,Photography is a way of making a picture using a camera. A person who makes pictures using a camera is called a photographer. A picture made using a camera is called a photograph. A picture made using a camera is called a photo. Photography became popular in the middle 19th century. Daguerreotype made photography popular. Wet plate methods were invented later. Dry plate methods were invented later. Most photography in the 20th century was on photographic film. Most photography in the 21st century uses digital cameras. A camera is like a box with a hole in front of it. There is a special piece of glass in front of the hole called a lens. The lens makes a small picture of the object inside the camera. The lens focuses light to make a small picture. A lens in a camera works like a lens in glasses. A lens in a camera works like a lens in a magnifying glass. Pinhole cameras have no lens. Pinhole cameras use a very small hole to focus light. To make a photograph with a camera the shutter release button is pressed. Pressing the button opens the shutter. The shutter is like a door. The shutter covers the hole in the camera box. The shutter is behind the lens. When the shutter is closed no light can enter the camera box. When the shutter is open light can enter the camera. When the button is pressed the shutter opens. Then the shutter closes. This happens very fast. The amount of time the shutter stays open is called the shutter speed. The shutter speed can change between 1/1000th of a second to a few seconds. Some cameras have an aperture ring. An aperture ring controls how much light enters the camera box. The photograph in a film camera is made on film. The photograph in a digital camera is made using an electronic sensor. The picture the lens makes is recorded on photographic film. Film is placed inside the camera box. Light coming through the lens shines on the film. Light coming through the aperture shines on the film. Light coming through the open shutter shines on the film. Photographic film is coated with chemicals that react when light shines on it. Letting light shine on the film is called exposing the film. There are many different types of photographic film. There are films for taking colour photographs. There are films for taking black photographs. There are films for taking white photographs. There are different sizes of film. The most common size of film is 35mm. The width of 35mm film is 35 millimetres. Another difference between films is how sensitive they are to light.

National Popular Vote Interstate Compact,"The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact is an agreement. The agreement changes how the Electoral College chooses the president. The states agree to give their Electoral College votes to the person with the most votes from regular people in the entire country. The agreement makes sure the person with the most votes will become president. The agreement will become active when the result is guaranteed. Eleven states are in the agreement. The District of Columbia is in the agreement. Together, the members have 172 electoral votes. The electoral votes are called 'electoral votes'. The agreement will become active when it has 270 electoral votes. The NPVIC is an interstate compact. The agreement will become active when its members control most of the Electoral College. Before the agreement becomes active, the members will give their electoral votes the way they do now. After the agreement becomes active, the members will give all their electoral votes to the person with the most votes from Americans. The person with the most votes wins the 'popular vote'. The person with the most votes will become president. Article 2, Section 1, Clause 2, of the U.S. Constitution lets state legislatures decide how to give their votes in the Electoral College. The Constitution does not say how the states must give their votes. The 14th Amendment says that states cannot discriminate against some groups of people. In the past, states used different ways to give their votes. Today, most states give all their electoral votes to the person with the most votes in that state. Maine separates their electoral votes between districts. Nebraska separates their electoral votes between districts. The NPVIC changes how its members give out their electoral votes. Some people who did not get the most votes became president anyway. Most Americans want the person with the most votes to be president. In 2007, 72% of surveyed Americans said they wanted to change the Electoral College to a direct vote. In 2007, 78% of Democrats wanted to change the Electoral College to a direct vote.

Surveys since 1944 show most Americans want a direct vote. Surveys in 2016 did not show most Americans want a direct vote. Reasons for the NPVIC include that a person can become president even if another person got more votes. This happened in 1824. This happened in 1876. This happened in 1888. This happened in 2000. This happened in 2016. In 2000, Al Gore got 543,895 more votes than George W. Bush. Al Gore did not become president. In 2016, Hillary Clinton got 2,868,691 more votes nationally than Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton did not become president. The easiest way to win an election is to campaign mostly in a few 'swing states'. The vote in swing states is usually very close. A small change in the votes in swing states can make a big difference in the Electoral College. Problems in swing states get the most attention. Problems in other states get much less attention. In the 2004 election, people running for president spent three-quarters of their money in only five states. In the 2004 election, they did not visit at all in 18 states. In the 2004 election, they did not advertise at all in 18 states."

Cache (computing),Caching is a term used in computer science. The idea behind a cache is simple. Obtaining a result for a calculation is often time-consuming. Storing the result is generally a good idea. Two kinds of storage media are used. One storage medium is usually big. Accessing the big storage medium is slow. The other storage medium can be accessed faster. The faster storage medium is generally small. The basic idea behind caching is to use fast-access storage. Copies of data are stored in the fast-access storage. Accessing the original data may take a long time. Accessing the original data may be expensive. Using the copy from the cache is cheaper. A cache is a temporary storage area. The cache has copies of data that are used often. Using the cache copy is faster than re-fetching the original data. Caching makes average access time shorter. Putting a new value into a cache means replacing an older value. There are different strategies to select values to replace. A buffer is similar to a cache. The client knows about the buffer. The buffer is managed by the application. The client need not be aware of a cache. Typical computer applications access data in similar ways. Data is structured into blocks. Blocks can be accessed individually. Accessing one block makes it likely to access a nearby block. This is known as locality of reference. There are different kinds of locality. Locality of reference helps caches work well. Caches are small compared to the whole data amount. Larger caches take longer to lookup entries. Larger caches are more expensive to build. A cache is a block of memory for storing data. Data in the cache is likely to be used again. The CPU uses a cache. Hard drives use a cache. Web browsers use a cache. Web servers use a cache. A cache is made up of entries called a pool. Each entry holds a copy of data from another place. Caches use a backing store. Backing stores are slow to access. Backing stores are expensive to access. A disk cache uses a hard disk as a backing store. Each cache entry has a tag. The tag finds the original data's location. The client wants to access data believed to be in the backing store. The client first checks the cache for the data.

Eusociality,"Eusociality is a term in animal behaviour. Eusociality describes complex kinds of social organisation. The term 'eusocial' was introduced in 1966 by Suzanne Batra. E.O. Wilson gave 'eusocial' a more precise meaning. At the start, 'eusocial' was used for invertebrates only. Usually, 'eusocial' was used for social insects. Eusociality has main features. Different animals have different jobs to do. There is a division of labour in eusociality. Some castes in eusociality may be sterile. Animal generations overlap in eusociality. Different generations are present in the hive. Different generations are present in the nest. Animals cooperate to care for the young in eusociality. Presociality is a term for simpler kinds of sociality. Presociality is also known as basal kinds of sociality. There have been definition debates on eusociality. After Wilson's original definition, others discussed it. Some wanted to change details of eusociality. The most familiar examples of eusociality are insects. Examples include ants. Examples include bees. Examples include wasps. Examples include termites. Eusocial insects are colonial animals. Colonial insects have queens for reproduction. Workers in colonial insects are usually sterile. Soldiers in colonial insects are usually sterile. Usually, workers cannot have offspring. Usually, soldiers cannot have offspring. Two known mammal species are eusocial. Known eusocial mammals are the naked mole rat. Known eusocial mammals are the Damaraland mole rat. Eusociality with sterile individuals is extreme kin altruism. Sterile individuals do specialized tasks. Sterile individuals often care for reproductive members. Eusocial animals have modified behaviour for group defence. Eusocial animals have modified body shape for group defence. Eusocial animals have modified function for group defence. They include self-sacrifice, also known as altruism. Eusociality played a key role in sociobiology theories. Naked mole rats are eusocial mammals. Naked mole rat colonies average 75-80 individuals. Colonies live together in complex burrow systems. Burrow systems are in arid African deserts. Naked mole rat tunnel systems can be long. Recently, some species of gall-making aphids are eusocial. Some species of thrips are eusocial. They have many separate origins of the eusocial state. High relatedness between individuals is due to reproduction mode."
Four color theorem,"The four color theorem is a theorem of mathematics. It says that any plane surface with regions can be colored with no more than four colors. Two regions that share a common border must not get the same color. Regions are called adjacent if they share a segment of the border. Regions are not adjacent if they only share a point. The four color theorem was the first theorem to be proved by a computer. The first proof was a proof by exhaustion. In proof by exhaustion, the conclusion is established by dividing it into cases. Each case is proved separately. There may be a lot of cases in a proof by exhaustion.. The first proof of the four color theorem had 1,936 cases. This proof was controversial. Most of the cases were checked by a computer program. They were not checked by hand. The shortest known proof of the four color theorem today has over 600 cases. The problem was first presented as a problem to color political maps of countries. Mapmakers are not very interested in it. According to Kenneth May, maps using only four colors are rare. Maps using four colors usually require only three. Books on cartography do not mention the four-color property. Books on the history of mapmaking do not mention the four-color property. Many simpler maps can be colored using three colors. Some maps need a fourth color. One such map has a region surrounded by an odd number of others. These other regions touch each other in a cycle. One example is given in the image. The five color theorem states that five colors are enough to color a map. The five color theorem has a short, elementary proof. The five color theorem was proven in the late 19th century. Proving that four colors are all that is needed was much more difficult. Many false proofs appeared since the first statement of the four color theorem in 1852. False counterexamples also appeared. The four color theorem states that any plane can be separated into contiguous regions that are called a map. These regions can be colored using at most four colors. No two regions which are adjacent should have the same color. It is necessary to clarify some aspects to solve correctly. Every country has to be a simply connected region. Four colors may not be enough for such maps. A simplified map with two regions labeled A requires five colors. The two A regions are contiguous with four other regions. Each of the four other regions touch each other. Maps that need an arbitrarily high number of colors can be made. A similar construction applies if one color is used for all bodies of water. An easier version of the four color theorem uses graph theory. The set of regions of a map can be represented as an undirected graph. One vertex represents each region. An edge represents every pair of regions sharing a boundary segment. This graph is planar. The graph can be drawn in the plane without crossings. Vertices are placed at locations within regions."
2008 Sichuan earthquake,"The 2008 Sichuan earthquake was a big earthquake in China. The earthquake happened on May 12, 2008. Thousands of people were killed. Thousands of people were missing. Thousands of people were hurt. Millions of people were left homeless. Their houses fell down. The earthquake could be felt 58 kilometers away. The earthquake was measured at 8.0 Ms by the China Seismological Bureau. The earthquake was measured at 8.3 Mw by the China Seismological Bureau. The earthquake happened at 2 PM. The earthquake happened at a depth of 19 kilometers. The earthquake was felt in Beijing. Beijing is 1500 kilometers away. The earthquake was felt in Shanghai. Shanghai is 1700 kilometers away. Tall office buildings in Beijing shook with the tremor. Tall office buildings in Shanghai shook with the tremor. The earthquake was felt in nearby countries. It is believed that 69,227 people died. It is believed that 374,643 people were hurt. 17,923 people were listed as missing. This data is from September 2008. The earthquake left about 4.8 million people homeless. The number could be as high as 11 million. Approximately 15 million people lived in the affected area. It was the deadliest earthquake to hit China since the 1976 Tangshan earthquake. It was the strongest earthquake to hit China since the 1976 Tangshan earthquake. The 1976 Tangshan earthquake killed at least 240,000 people. 52 big aftershocks were recorded within 72 hours of the main tremor. The aftershocks ranged in size from 4.4 to 6.0. Scientists worked out that the earth moved up to 10 meters. This movement happened along the Longmen Shan Fault. The Longmen Shan Fault is about 500 kilometers long. The Longmen Shan Fault is 20 kilometers deep. The earthquake made the ground on the surface move more than 3 meters. Japanese seismologist Yuji Yagi said the earthquake took place in two parts. The fault tore in two sections. The first section moved about 4 meters. In the second section, the fault moved another 4 meters. The earthquake lasted about two minutes. It was powerful because it did not happen very deep under the ground. Many people were killed because there were many people living above the epicenter. Teruyuki Kato is a seismologist at the University of Tokyo. Teruyuki Kato said that the shock waves traveled a long way. The waves did not lose their power because of the hardness of the ground in central China. In Hong Kong, tremors were felt about 3 minutes after the quake. The tremors in Hong Kong lasted for 30 seconds. In Macau, tremors were felt about 3 minutes after the quake. In Vietnam, tremors were felt about 5 minutes after the earthquake."

Water turbine,"A water turbine is a rotary engine. A water turbine takes energy from moving water. Water turbines were developed in the nineteenth century. Water turbines were widely used for industrial power before electrical grids. Water turbines are now mostly used for electric power generation. Water turbines harness a clean energy source. Water turbines harness a renewable energy source. Swirl water wheels have been used for industrial power for thousands of years. The main shortcoming of water wheels is their size. The size of water wheels limits the flow rate that can be used. The size of water wheels limits the head that can be used. The migration from water wheels to modern turbines took about one hundred years. Development of modern turbines occurred during the Industrial Revolution. Development of modern turbines used scientific principles. Development of modern turbines used scientific methods. Modern turbines made use of new materials. Modern turbines made use of new manufacturing methods. Claude Bourdin coined the word turbine in the early 19th century. Claude Bourdin was a French engineer. The word turbine is derived from the Latin word for whirling. The word turbine is derived from the Latin word for a vortex. Early water turbines have a component of water passing energy to a spinning rotor. This component of motion allows the turbine to be smaller than a water wheel. This component of motion allows the turbine to process more water by spinning faster. Turbines can use much greater heads than water wheels. Impulse turbines do not use swirl. Ján Andrej Segner developed a reactive water turbine in the mid-1700s. Segner's turbine had a horizontal axis. Segner's turbine was a precursor to modern water turbines. Segner's turbine is a simple machine still produced today for small hydro sites. Segner worked with Euler on early mathematical theories of turbine design. Jean-Victor Poncelet developed an inward-flow turbine in 1820. Benoit Fourneyron developed an outward-flow turbine in 1826. Fourneyron's turbine was about 80% efficient. Fourneyron's turbine sent water through a runner with blades curved in one dimension. The stationary outlet of Fourneyron's turbine had curved guides. Uriah A. Boyden developed an outward flow turbine in 1844. Boyden's turbine improved on the performance of the Fourneyron turbine. The runner shape of Boyden's turbine was similar to that of a Francis turbine. In 1849, James B. Francis improved the inward flow reaction turbine to over 90% efficiency. Francis conducted sophisticated tests on water turbine design. Francis developed engineering methods for water turbine design. The Francis turbine is named after James B. Francis. The Francis turbine is the first modern water turbine. The Francis turbine is still the most widely used water turbine in the world. Inward flow water turbines have a better mechanical arrangement. All modern reaction water turbines use an inward flow design. As the swirling mass of water spins into a tighter rotation, it tries to speed up to conserve energy. This property acts on the runner. This property is in addition to the water's falling weight."
Rachel Berry,"Rachel Berry is a fictional character. She is from the FOX musical comedy-drama series Glee. Lea Michele plays the character. Rachel first appeared in Glee's pilot episode. The pilot episode was first broadcast on May 19, 2009. Ryan Murphy created Rachel. Brad Falchuk created Rachel. Ian Brennan created Rachel. Rachel is the glee club captain.

Rachel had many dates with quarterback Finn Hudson. Cory Monteith played Finn Hudson. Finn co-captains the glee club. Michele stated she was like Rachel when younger. She had inspiration to play Rachel. Inspiration includes the movie Election. Television roles also inspired her. One role is Blair Waldorf from Gossip Girl. Michele feels vulnerable playing Rachel. Rachel will never be popular because of her looks. Michele said it was the same in her high school. Michele did not get a nose job. Every girl around Michele did. Michele was therefore out. Glee shows how such stuff hurts. It does not matter. You can still be who you want to be. She is somewhat nervous about herself. Glee follows Rachel's journey. Rachel becomes more of a team player. She does this to fulfill her dreams. Michele was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award. The nomination was for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. It was in 2010. Michele was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award. Rachel has received mostly positive reviews from critics. Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune praised Michele. Ryan thanked Michele for making Rachel more than a stereotype. The Wall Street Journal's Raymund Flandez described Rachel. He described Rachel as insufferable. Several songs by Michele as Rachel were released. They were released as digital singles. They were included on the series' soundtrack albums."
Adaptive radiation,"Adaptive radiation is rapid evolutionary radiation. Adaptive radiation is an increase in the number of species. Adaptive radiation is an increase in the diversity of species. Adaptive radiation produces more new species. New species from adaptive radiation live in a wider range of habitats. Adaptive radiation can be phrased in terms of a single clade. Adaptive radiation is the rapid proliferation of new taxa from a single ancestral group. In striking cases, many lines underwent rapid radiation simultaneously. Rapid radiation happened after the greatest extinction event in Earth history. Rapid radiation is linked to the availability of ecological niches. Rapid radiation is linked to little competition. The Ediacaran biota were the result of an early metazoan radiation. The greatest radiation of all took place early in the Cambrian period. In the Cambrian period, most of our animal phyla evolved. Groups diversify to fill available habitats with less competition. Groups diversify to fill available niches with less competition. Adaptive radiation is an evolutionary process. Natural selection drives the evolutionary process. George Gaylord Simpson introduced the term adaptive radiation. George Gaylord Simpson discussed the term adaptive radiation. Robert L Carroll prefers the term major evolutionary transitions. Most major evolutionary transitions could be described as adaptive radiations. Some use the term macroevolution. Some use the term megaevolution. All processes take place at the level of populations. The speed of evolution does change. The speed of evolution changes however it is measured. Measurement of rates of change is affected by gaps in the fossil record. Fossil record gaps are often at those crucial early stages. Fossil record gaps are there when numbers are low. Fossil record gaps are there when geographical distribution is restricted. Nearly every lineage has long periods with unknown fossil records. These gaps affect our knowledge of timing. These gaps affect our knowledge of changes in body shape. These gaps affect our knowledge of changes in function. Several new lines appearing within a short period indicates a fast rate of change. An example is the appearance of new reptilian groups in the Upper Triassic. These radiations occurred after the great Permian–Triassic extinction event. The Permian–Triassic extinction event ended the Palaeozoic era. The Triassic had several lesser extinctions. The Triassic had significant extinctions. The Triassic has the poorest fossil record of the Mesozoic era. The evolution of a new feature may let a group diversify. A new feature makes possible new ways of living. The cleidoic egg is a striking example. The cleidoic egg developed in early amniotes. The cleidoic egg permitted vertebrates to invade the land. The cleidoic egg must have developed in the latest Devonian. The cleidoic egg must have developed in the early Carboniferous. Amphibians still lay their eggs in water."

Local government in England,"England is divided into up to four levels of administrative divisions for local government purposes. Various legislation has created alternative types of administrative division at some levels. England is divided into nine regions. The regions were created in 1994. The regions have been used as England's European Parliament constituencies since the 1999 Euro-elections. All the regions have the same status. London is the only region with any devolved power. London has an elected mayor. London has the Greater London Authority. The regions vary greatly in their areas. The regions vary greatly in their populations. England is divided by the Lieutenancies Act 1997 into areas for the appointment of Lord Lieutenants. Lord Lieutenants are historically the Crown's representative in a county. The areas have become known as ceremonial counties. These counties are sometimes used by people to describe where they live in England. Many of the counties are not used as local government areas. The ceremonial counties are sometimes too large to be local government areas. Some ceremonial counties include large urban areas. The counties are considered when drawing up Parliamentary constituency boundaries. England is divided into four types of county-level subnational entities used for local governance. There are six metropolitan counties. The metropolitan counties are divided into metropolitan boroughs. The metropolitan boroughs cover large urban areas outside London. The metropolitan counties were created in 1974. County councils of metropolitan counties were abolished in 1986. The 'shire counties' were created in 1974. The shire counties are non-metropolitan counties. The shire counties are divided into non-metropolitan districts. The shire counties cover much of the country. The shire counties mainly cover rural areas. Unitary authorities were created in the 1990s. Unitary authorities are single-tier authorities. The Isle of Wight is a county council with no districts. Greater London was created in 1965. Greater London is sometimes considered as a metropolitan county. Greater London is not defined as a metropolitan county. Greater London is divided into the City of London. Greater London is divided into London boroughs. Districts in England may have the status of borough. Districts in England may have the status of city. Districts in England may have the status of royal borough. The metropolitan counties were divided into metropolitan districts. Metropolitan districts are usually called boroughs. When the county councils were abolished, the metropolitan districts gained much of their powers. Metropolitan districts function similarly to unitary authorities. Shire counties are divided into non-metropolitan districts. Power is shared with the county council in shire counties. Power is shared differently to when metropolitan counties were first created. The civil parish is the most local unit of government in England. Civil parishes are not permitted within the boundary of Greater London."

Antibiotic resistance,"Antibiotics kill certain types of bacteria. Bacteria change over time. Bacteria develop a resistance to antibiotics. This change is called antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance is a serious problem. Antibiotic resistance affects modern surgery. Antibiotic resistance affects modern medicine. Antibiotic resistance is an example of evolution. Antibiotic resistance spreads very quickly. Antibiotic resistance spreads faster than expected. New drugs can make resistance not a problem. No new class of antibiotics has been discovered since the 1980s. This was true until recently. Some scientists have developed new antibiotics. These antibiotics combat resistant bacteria. The process is extremely costly. Antibiotic resistance is natural selection in action. Penicillin was discovered in 1928. Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin. Antibiotics fight bacterial diseases. Natural populations of bacteria have genetic variation. This variation results from mutations. Most bacteria die quickly when exposed to antibiotics. Some bacteria have mutations that make them less susceptible. These bacteria survive short antibiotic exposure. This is selective elimination. Selective elimination is natural selection. Fleming predicted antibiotic resistance in 1945. He explained it occurs with low concentrations of antibiotics. He said it has happened in the body. Fleming warned about the danger of buying penicillin. Improper dosage can lead to resistance. Maclyn McCarty explained pre-antibiotic infections. No one recovered from certain infections before antibiotics. Bacteria become resistant via genetic mutation. Bacteria become resistant via horizontal gene transfer. Surgery poses risks of infection. Antibiotics are given before surgery. Antibiotics are given after surgery. This allows for safer operations. Open-heart surgery is an example. Cancer treatments damage the immune system. Antibiotics boost the immune system. Organ transplant patients use drugs to suppress the immune system. Antibiotics protect these patients. Without antibiotics, patients could die from infections. Professor Richard James predicts a grim future. Major surgery could be threatened. Medical uses of antibiotics are threatened. Carbapenem resistance cases have increased since 2003."
Solid-state chemistry,Solid-state chemistry is the study of the synthesis of solid phase materials. Solid-state chemistry studies the structure of solid phase materials. Solid-state chemistry studies the properties of solid phase materials. Solid-state chemistry is also called materials chemistry. Solid-state chemistry focuses on non-molecular solids. Solid-state chemistry has much in common with solid-state physics. Solid-state chemistry has much in common with mineralogy. Solid-state chemistry has much in common with crystallography. Solid-state chemistry has much in common with ceramics. Solid-state chemistry has much in common with metallurgy. Solid-state chemistry has much in common with thermodynamics. Solid-state chemistry has much in common with materials science. Solid-state chemistry has much in common with electronics. Solid-state chemistry focuses on the synthesis of new materials. Solid-state chemistry focuses on the characterization of new materials. Technology helps solid-state inorganic chemistry. Solid-state chemistry works to make materials used in commerce. Researchers in solid-state chemistry serve industry. Researchers in solid-state chemistry answer academic questions. There were many important discoveries in solid-state chemistry in the 20th century. Zeolite catalysts were discovered in the 1950s. Platinum-based catalysts were discovered in the 1950s. High-purity silicon was discovered in the 1960s. High-purity silicon is a core component of microelectronic devices. High temperature superconductivity was discovered in the 1980s. William Lawrence Bragg invented X-ray crystallography in the early 1900s. X-ray crystallography brought further discoveries. Carl Wagner worked on oxidation rate theory. Carl Wagner worked on the counter diffusion of ions. Carl Wagner worked on defect chemistry. Carl Wagner's work showed how reactions proceed at the atomic level. Carl Wagner's work focused on the solid state. Carl Wagner is sometimes referred to as the father of solid state chemistry. Synthetic methods are used to make solid-state compounds. A diverse variety of synthetic methods are used. Organic materials are sometimes synthesized near room temperature. Charge transfer salts are synthesized near room temperature. Methods for synthesizing organic materials are similar to organic synthesis methods. Redox reactions are sometimes conducted by electrocrystallisation. Bechgaard salts are synthesized from tetrathiafulvalene. High temperature methods are used for materials that can withstand heat. Tube furnaces are used to prepare bulk solids. Tube furnaces allow reactions to be conducted up to around a certain temperature. Special equipment such as ovens made with a tantalum tube are used for higher temperatures. Electric current is passed through a tantalum tube in these ovens. High temperatures are sometimes required to induce diffusion of reactants. Some solid state reactions proceed at lower temperatures. Chemists often melt the reactants together to synthesize materials. The solidified melt is later annealed. Volatile reactants are often put in an ampoule.

"Orange County, Virginia","Orange County is a county in the central piedmont region of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The population was 33,481 as of the 2010 census. The county seat is Orange. Orange County is home to Montpelier. Montpelier is the estate of James Madison. James Madison was the 4th President of the United States. The county celebrated its 275th anniversary in 2009. The area was lived in for thousands of years by different cultures of Native Americans. The Ontponea lived in the Piedmont area at the time the Europeans came. The Ontponea were a sub-group of the Siouan-speaking Manahoac tribe. The first European settlement in Orange County was Germanna. Germanna was formed when Governor Alexander Spotswood settled 12 immigrant families from Westphalia in 1714. This was a total of 42 people. Orange County was created in August 1734. The Virginia House of Burgesses created Orange County. They adopted 'An Act for Dividing Spotsylvania County.' Unlike other counties, Orange was bounded on the west by the utmost limits of Virginia. The colony of Virginia claimed the land. Very little of the claimed land had been occupied by English people. Orange County may have been the largest county that ever existed at one time. In 1738, most of the western area of Orange County was split off into Augusta County. The large county was to encourage settlement further west. This was to counter the French claim to the Ohio River Valley region. No battles of the American Revolutionary War were fought in Orange County. 100 men from Orange County were recruited to the Culpeper Minutemen. They fought in the Battle of Great Bridge. The development of transportation helped build an agricultural economy in Orange County. This included several railroad routes up through the mid-nineteenth century. The final adjustment of the county’s boundaries occurred in 1838. Greene County was created from the western portion of Orange. The Town of Orange served as the county seat for nearly a century. The Town of Orange was legally established in 1834. It officially became a town in 1872. The Town of Gordonsville officially became a town in 1870. The county saw limited conflict during the Civil War. The Battle of the Wilderness was a significant turning point in the Civil War. Virginia was readmitted to the Union in 1870. These activities required less physical labor. The dominance of the railroad increased livestock production in the county’s agricultural economy. There was a peak of 1,279 farms as of 1929. There were 20 manufacturing companies located within the county as of 1929. A manufacturing survey during the Great Depression noted that Orange County’s economy remained relatively healthy due to its accessibility. The significance of agriculture to Orange County’s history was great. The Commonwealth of Virginia set aside the Madison-Barbour Rural Historic District in the western portion of the county. The District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. It is the largest such district in Virginia. It includes James Madison’s Montpelier. It includes James Barbour’s Barboursville mansion. Thomas Jefferson designed the Barboursville mansion. The Barboursville mansion is now in ruins."
Origin of life,"The origin of life on Earth is a scientific problem. This problem is not yet solved. There are many ideas. There are few clear facts. Most experts agree all life today evolved. Life today evolved by common descent. This descent is from a single primitive lifeform. It is not known how this early life form evolved. Scientists think this evolution was a natural process. This process happened about 3,900 million years ago. This view is in accord with the philosophy of naturalism. Only natural causes are admitted in naturalism. It is unknown if metabolism came first. It is unknown if genetics came first. The RNA world hypothesis supports genetics first. The protein world hypothesis supports metabolism first. Another big problem is how cells developed. Melvin Calvin wrote a book on the subject. Melvin Calvin won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Alexander Oparin also wrote a book on the subject. Before life began, there must have been a process of chemical change. J.D. Bernal discussed the origin of the cell membrane. Others also discussed the origin of the cell membrane. The cell membrane concentrates chemicals in one place. The cell membrane performs a vital function. Life is verified in things that include RNA. Life includes mechanisms for encoding RNA. Life includes mechanisms for decoding RNA. Life includes mechanisms for building proteins from amino acids. The search for a verifiable theory of biogenesis is a separate field of research. Fossilized microorganisms are the earliest claimed lifeforms. These microorganisms are also called microfossils. These microfossils were found in iron-rich rocks. These microfossils were found in silica-rich rocks. These rocks were once hydrothermal vents. These rocks are in the Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt. The Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt is in Quebec, Canada. These rocks are as old as 4.28 billion years. The tubular forms in these rocks are shown in a report. If this is the oldest record of life on Earth, it suggests an almost instantaneous emergence of life. Oceans formed 4.4 billion years ago. Stephen Blair Hedges made a statement. He said life could be common in the universe. A scientific study from 2002 showed geological formations of stromatolites. These stromatolites are 3.45 billion years old. These stromatolites contain fossilized cyanobacteria. It was widely agreed that stromatolites were the oldest known lifeforms. Stromatolites left a record of their existence. Water vapor first liquefied 4.4 billion years ago. The latest discovery is discussed above."

He saw balloons hanging from the ceiling of the store. Twenty years later, Walters decided to try flying with balloons. Walters planned to attach large balloons filled with helium to his lawn chair. He planned to float above his backyard. He planned to stay about 30 feet up in the air. He planned to stay about 9 meters up in the air for several hours. Walters had a pellet gun to break some balloons. He wanted to move back to the ground softly. In 1982, Walters bought 45 eight-foot weather balloons. They got helium tanks from California Toy Time Balloons. They used a fake letter from Walters' employer. The letter said the balloons were for a television commercial.

The new settlers saw an island to the southwest later. The islands were found to be completely uninhabited. They had to cut part of the dense forest. They had to construct a large number of canals to carry water. Some parts of the island had excess water. Other parts of the island had scarce water. During this period, fish constituted about half of the settlers' diet. Initially, colonists produced wheat for their own subsistence. Later, they cultivated enough wheat to begin sending it to continental Portugal. On 23 September 1433, the name Ilha da Madeira began to appear in documents. The name's English translation is Madeira Island. The name literally means island of wood. The name was given due to the large dense forests of native trees on the island. Wheat production began to fall. The crisis forced the settlers to plant other commercial crops. They brought sugarcane plants from Sicily. The settlers produced sugar from the sugarcane.

Hurricane Floyd (1987),"Hurricane Floyd made landfall only in the United States during the 1987 Atlantic hurricane season. Floyd was the last of seven tropical storms. Floyd was the last of three hurricanes. Floyd developed on 9 October. Floyd developed off the east coast of Nicaragua. Floyd became a tropical storm. Floyd moved northward, then crossed western Cuba. A cold front was approaching. Floyd turned to the northeast. Floyd became a hurricane near the Florida Keys late on 12 October. Floyd moved through the south of Florida. Floyd produced two tornadoes. The tornadoes caused some damage. The hurricane produced rip tides. The rip tides killed one person in southern Texas. Floyd was a hurricane for twelve hours. Floyd became weak because of the cold front. Floyd passed through the Bahamas. Floyd became extratropical. Floyd dissipated on 14 October. Hurricane Floyd originated from a low-pressure area in the Gulf of Honduras on October 5. The low-pressure area drifted eastward in the next few days. The low-pressure area moved southward. The low-pressure area moved off the east coast of Nicaragua. A Hurricane Hunters flight confirmed an organized circulation on October 9. This confirmation showed the year’s thirteenth tropical depression had developed. The depression drifted more to the south. The depression turned north. The depression later turned northwest due to a ridge to its east. An anticyclone formed over the depression. The depression gradually organized. The depression became stronger. It was named Tropical Storm Floyd on October 10. Floyd accelerated to the north in the western Caribbean Sea. This acceleration was due to a cold front approaching. Floyd became more intense. The storm moved over extreme western Cuba early on October 12. The storm moved sharply northeastward into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. Hurricane Hunters reported Floyd became a hurricane on October 12 briefly. A nearby cold front created a low-pressure area around the same time. This low-pressure area cut off Floyd's inflow. Floyd became the only hurricane to affect the United States in 1987 while moving through the Florida Keys. Floyd's convection was decreasing fast over the center due to the front. Floyd weakened to tropical storm status soon after. The circulation became nearly impossible to track on satellite imagery. Surface observations showed Floyd passed just south of Miami. Floyd turned extratropical. Floyd went through extratropical transition. Floyd changed from a tropical storm to an extratropical one as it weakened over the Bahamas. Floyd was no longer a tropical cyclone by late on October 18."

Hedonic adaptation,"Hedonic adaptation is the idea that humans get used to good events over time. Hedonic adaptation is the idea that humans get used to bad events over time. Good events change happiness in the moment. Bad events change happiness in the moment. People get used to good events. People get used to bad events. This getting used is called adaptation. Because of adaptation, happiness usually stays the same over time. Hedonic adaptation is also called the hedonic treadmill. Looking for good events will make a person adapt to them. Looking for good events will make the person want more. Hedonic adaptation was developed in 1971. Scientists found that lottery winners were not happier than those who did not win. Scientists found that those who could not walk were not much less happy than those who could. Newer studies show the same results. A 15-year-long study shows that married people in Germany were much happier after marriage. By the second year, their happiness was the same as before they got married. These studies show that it may not be possible to increase happiness for a long period of time. Hedonic adaptation contains two important ideas. How people feel about an event depends on how they feel before it happened. Good events make people happy in the moment. Over time, because people are already happy, their happiness does not change. Happiness usually returns to a point that stays the same. This is how people get used to events over time. Scientists thought that happiness returns to a neutral point. This neutral point is where a person is not happy nor sad. New studies show that most people are happy most of the time. Happiness returns to a point where the person is happy. This happiness point is different for everyone. How happy a person is depends on personality. Personality can come from their parents. Hedonic adaptation comes from cognitive changes. Cognitive changes are changes in how a person thinks. Thinking about an event less is the main way adaptation happens. Hedonic adaptation also comes from neurochemical changes. Neurochemical changes are changes in the brain. Neurochemical changes make good feelings less strong. Neurochemical changes make bad feelings less strong. People do not get used to all events. Most studies show that people usually adapt to good events quickly. Most studies show that people adapt to good events completely. Happiness returns to exactly where it was before the good event. Happiness returns soon after the good event happens. Some strong bad events result in less adaptation. Some long-lasting bad events result in less adaptation. Losing a job results in less adaptation. Losing a partner results in less adaptation. Happiness may not completely return to its point before the bad event. In some situations, happiness may decrease. Hedonic adaptation is useful from an evolutionary position."

Social responses to the idea of evolution,"Evolution was an idea debated before Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species. Evolution says that species change over time. Some people still talk about the concept of evolution. People discuss evolution's meaning to their philosophy. People discuss evolution's meaning to their religion. People also talk about the social implications of evolution. This debate is mostly about evolution's meaning to human life. This debate is about human nature. This debate is not about how evolution works. Some people believe in guided evolution. Some people believe in theistic evolution. They say evolution is real. They say it is being guided in some way. There are many different concepts of theistic evolution. Many creationists believe their religion's creation myth goes against the idea of evolution. Darwin found out early on. Evolution's implications for human origins are the most controversial part. There is tension especially in the United States. The debate is mostly about if the ideas in evolution should be taught in schools. The debate is also about in what way evolution should be taught. These ideas were once fiercely opposed. Death for heresy was threatened to those writing against the idea that the Earth was the center of the universe. Giordano Bruno was burnt at the stake by the Holy Inquisition. Bruno was teaching that the Earth moved around the Sun. Bruno had other ideas. The Roman Catholic Church now has a neutral position with regards to evolution. Pope Pius XII stated this position in his encyclical Humani Generis. Humani Generis was published in the 1950s. Pope John Paul II updated this position in 1996. Pope John Paul II said evolution was more than a hypothesis. The Anglican Communion does not oppose the scientific account of evolution. Many of those who accepted evolution were not much interested in biology. They were interested in using the theory to support their own ideas on society. In the Bible, after Noah's Ark landed, there is a passage that describes how Noah got drunk while naked. Ham laughed at Noah. Noah cursed Ham. Later, people tried to use evolution to support racism. Evolution itself is not about racism. People wanting to justify racism claimed that black people were inferior. They said evolution shows that better animals tend to survive. They believed they had the right to oppress the weaker. There is no agreed evidence that any race of humans is better than any other race. The idea of eugenics was different from using evolution to support racism. Lower class people had more children than upper-class people. Faster breeding in the lower classes would lead to the society getting worse. The idea to improve the human species by selective breeding is called eugenics. Francis Galton proposed the name eugenics. Galton was a bright scientist. Galton meant to do good. He was the first to use regression analysis."

Infiorata di Genzano,"The Flower Festival in Genzano is an event. It takes place in the Genzano section of Rome. It is characterized by the carpet of flowers. This carpet is set up in the path of the religious procession. This event is on the Feast of Corpus Christi. The festival dates back to the 18th century. Tradition dictated a floral carpet along the Via Sforza (now Via Bruno Buozzi) in Genzano. Previously, Genzano had the custom of preparing flower carpets for the feast of Corpus Christi. Other locations in the Castelli Romani also had this custom. The tradition began in Rome in the first half of the seventeenth century. The tradition spread to the localities of the Alban Hills. This region was closely tied to Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Bernini was the main architect of Baroque celebrations. It is believed that the tradition of creating paintings with flowers began in the Vatican basilica. The tradition was started by Benedetto Drei. Benedetto Drei was the head of the Florerian Vatican. His son Pietro also participated. They used leafless flowers minced to emulate mosaics. The first such painting was created on June 29, 1625. In 1633, Stefano Speranza made another floral painting. Speranza was a close associate of Bernini. Oreste Raggi stated that Bernini succeeded Benedetto Drei. Bernini popularized this art in Rome. The custom of flower displays disappeared in Rome at the end of the XVII century. It continued in Genzano into the eighteenth century. This is according to an anonymous manuscript from 1824. The manuscript is preserved in the Central National Library of Rome. Some families in Genzano displayed flowers in front of their homes. This was for the three different processions on the anniversary of Corpus Domini. One procession was on Thursday. The other two processions were on the following Sunday. None of these processions passed through Via Sforza. Don Arcangelo Leofreddi lived on Via Sforza. He asked the Bishop of Albano François-Joachim de Pierre de Bernis to vary the procession path. He made this request on the Thursday procession of the 8th. He obtained the permit. Don Leofreddi asked all Via Sforza inhabitants to make floral decorations. Each made decorations at their own expense. There is disagreement on the date of the first Flower Festival in Genzano. Some date it back to 1778. Others date it to June 6, 1782. Previous floral displays covered small garden sections. In the nineteenth century, the Genzano Flower Festival took place annually. There were some periods of interruption. The first interruption was from 1845 to 1863. The second interruption lasted from 1875 to 1894. It was restored in 1894 by the Catholic circle Company of Saint Luigi. In the early twentieth century, the floral display installation was not constant. The tradition resumed on the interdiocesian Eucharistic Congress of 1922. This Congress was held in Genzano."
History of saffron cultivation,"Saffron growing started more than 3,000 years ago. The wild plant from which the saffron crocus came was called Crocus cartwrightianus.

Experts believe that the first document to mention saffron is a book. The book is about botany. It was written in the 7th-century BC. It was written in the time of Ashurbanipal. Evidence shows use of saffron in treating about 90 illnesses. This use spans the past 4,000 years. The Minoans had pictures of saffron in their palaces. These pictures date back to 1500–1600 BC. These pictures showed saffron used as medicine. Greek legends told of sea voyages to Cilicia for saffron. Adventurers hoped to find the world's most valuable saffron in Cilicia.
