# WikiAtomic
This repository hosts the dataset associated with our paper titled “[When Context Leads but Parametric Memory Follows in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08435)”. Our work has been accepted for presentation at the 2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

## Dataset Overview
- wikiatomic.csv (todo): Contains all 10,000 atomic sentences seperated by topics.
- subdatasets for each model: The folder contains 9 csv files that each one contains questions we used in our paper and corresponding responses from each LLM.
